“Good morning sir/ma’am. First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is Shubham Karad, and I am from Ahmednagar, Maharashtra.
I have recently completed my graduation in 2025. Currently, I am doing my internship as a MERN Stack Developer at A2Z IT HUB, where I am gaining hands-on experience in real-time projects.

Talking about my technical skills, I have strong knowledge of frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React.js. On the backend side, I have experience with Node.js and Express.js, and I can work with databases like MySQL and MongoDB. During my internship, I worked on projects like e-commerce and restaurant management systems, which helped me improve my problem-solving and teamwork abilities.

My strengths are quick learning, adaptability, and teamwork. I always stay positive and try to complete my tasks within the deadline.
As for my weakness, sometimes I focus too much on small details, but I am working on balancing accuracy with efficiency.

My short-term goal is to gain practical knowledge through internships and projects, while my long-term goal is to become a successful full-stack developer and contribute to the IT industry with innovative solutions.

Apart from coding, my hobbies are exploring new technologies, reading about the latest IT trends, and sometimes solving logical problems or puzzles to sharpen my mind.
That’s all about me. Thank you.”
